This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
# Install the required package RSQLite (contains driver for SQLite)
```{r}

```

#Load both the packages
```{r}
require(RSQLite)
require(MASS)
```
Check to see if the Boston table is available
```{r}
head(Boston)
```
create the file path to the simplecharter database
```{r}
dbFile = "C:/Users/jare/SkyDrive/WorkDocs/CUNY/Data_Analytics/Data_Programming/Databases/simplecharter.sqlite"
```

use a variable to store the type of driver
```{r}
drv = "SQLite"
```
set the connection properties for the connection and store the connection in a connection object
```{r}
con = dbConnect(drv, dbFile)
```
list the tables in the connected database using the connection
```{r}
dbListTables(con)
```

read the data from one of the tables (allcharters) into a dataframe (myDataFrame)
```{r}
myDataFrame = dbReadTable(con, "allcharters")
```
Display the first few rows of the new dataframe
```{r}
head(myDataFrame)
```
write the data from Boston into the sqlite database

```{r}
dbWriteTable(con, "newBoston", Boston)
```

list the tables in the simplecharter database again
```{r}
dbListTables(con)
```
display the first 10 rows of the newBoston table
```{r}
dbReadTable(con, "newBoston")[1:10,]
```
close connection
```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
